# Currency-detector-App
Visually impaired individuals face difficulties in distinguishing different types of currency notes, which makes it challenging for them to carry out financial transactions independently. This problem can cause inconvenience, delay, and even potential financial loss. Therefore, there is a need for a device or system that can detect and identify different types of currency notes accurately and provide audio or tactile feedback to visually impaired individuals. The currency detector should be portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective to enable independent financial transactions and enhance the quality of life of visually impaired individuals.

currency detector app typically provides several voice outputs to the user. The primary output is the identification of the currency, which is typically displayed on the screen along with the currency's value in the user's preferred currency.
